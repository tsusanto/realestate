You will hear this many times, most real estate agents do not make it past the first 2 years. Estimates range as high as 90% failure rate within the first two years.

It is hard to exactly prove how many real estate licensees give up after the first 2 years, but looking at the data published by CA DRE, I can extrapolate some facts by looking at the number of new licenses issued in 2015, and seeing how many of those people who got their licenses in 2015 still have a valid and active licensees in the year 2021. 

Why did I pick 2015's data? That's because in California, real estate licenses are valid for 4 years, and they are given a grace period of 2 years to renew it. If they were still actively participating in the industry, they would have renewed their licenses by now.

From DRE's website, they issued 25,210 new salesperson and broker licenses for the entire year of 2015. In February 2021, more than 5 years later, there were only 11,042 people who got their licenses in 2015 with a still valid license and attached to a brokerage (salesperson licensees have to hang their licenses with a brokerage in order to do any business).

That means only 43% of the agents who took up their new license in 2015 remained in business in 2021.  In other words, 57% of the people who worked so hard to pass their exam, simply gave up. Of the people remaining, I have yet to find enough data to determine how many of them are actually making a living wage. If you have any ideas where I can find data, let me know!
