As of February 2021, there are 416,721 people who possess a valid Real Estate Salesperson or Brokers license. There are 39.3 million people in the state of California, which means 1 out of every 100 people in California holds a valid real estate license.

I find it mind boggling that there are more real estate licensees than credentialed school teachers (320K) in California.

As you can imagine, there are a lot of competition out there for a real estate agent. Based on the data in the table below, Orange County is a pretty competitive area to be an agent, as 1.75% of the total population hold a valid real estate license. Fresno County seems to be less competitive, with agents representing only 0.5% of the total population.
