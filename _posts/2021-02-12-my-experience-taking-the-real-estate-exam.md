### Scheduling the exam

Keep in mind that I took the real estate license exam during covid times, which is not usual and hopefully by the time you read this article, things will be back to normal.

I finally got an exam spot in Sacramento for Feb 2021. The testing centers in California have been closed for the last few months. The 20 spots (only 50% of allowed capacity due to Covid) filled up quickly.

There are 2 time slots for the exam, 8.45 am and 12.45 pm. For the salesperson license exam, the test is 3 hours long and you have to answer 150 questions and answer 105 questions correctly (70%). For the brokers license exam, the test is 4 hours long and you have to answer 200 questions and answer at least 150 questions correctly (75%).

There is a $20 rescheduling fee if you change your mind.

### Day of the exam

Since it's a 2.5 hours drive for me to Sacramento, I picked the day that offered the 12.45 pm exam. I ate a healthy big breakfast and packed lunch. I downloaded all the audio files from Prepagent and listened to it the whole time I was driving to Sacramento.

I arrived at 11.30 pm, went through more questions and answers on my phone. Even though the official exam time is at 12.45 pm, they allow you to register at the counter as early as 12.15 pm, and once you are registered, you can take start taking the test. 

I gobbled down my lunch, drank a lot of water about half hour before going in so I can use the bathroom before taking the exam. I do not recommend taking breaks during the exam, but they do allow you to.

When you register at the counter for the exam, they ask you to take everything out of your pockets and put it in the locker they provide. The only thing I was allowed to bring in was my driver's license and locker key and the reading glasses and mask I was wearing. They even asked me to show them the inside of my mask to make sure I didn't  write any notes inside my mask, ha!

### California Real Estate Exam format and my exam taking strategy

You then walk into the exam room to your assigned desk number. There will be one DRE employee supervising (no cheating!). The monitor is placed facing upwards through a glass desk. You are given a mouse, whiteboard, sharpie, and one calculator.

Because the monitor is beneath the desk, nobody can see your monitor and vice versa. But that means you would be spending hours looking down, so make sure to stretch your neck and look up every now and then.

There is zero math questions in my exam. I went through the questions in order, and if I wasn't confident of my answer and want to go back to it, I picked an answer anyway but wrote down the question number on my whiteboard.

After answering every question, I then went back back to the questions in order as written on my whiteboard. I had about 65 questions to go through again. I did this two more times, eliminating questions from my whiteboard when I felt I did the best I could. At the end, I only have about 28 questions that I did not feel confident about, even if I got all the 28 questions wrong, it's still a pass. 

For the questions I was unsure, I first eliminated the obvious wrong ones. Usually you can get it down to just 2 choices, giving you a 50% chance in answering it right. Sometimes you get a clue from other questions in the exam what the wrong answers are as similar questions come up in the exam and the answer choices of other questions might help you.

There is plenty of time given for the exam so time will not be an issue.

### Time to get your results 

I had 20 minutes left to spare on the clock, one of the last 4 people left, everybody left much earlier. Ignore the people who leave way early, assume they gave up and not because the exam was too easy for them. 

I clicked on the "End Exam" button on the screen. When I went to the counter, they asked for my ID again and immediately printed out the results and stapled up the paper and told me not to open it until I got out of the building. 

As soon as I got out I tore the paper open and it says "Congratulations! You passed ...". They will not give you your actual score, just either pass or fail.

My record in DRE elicensing was already updated by the time I drove back home, and there's now a new button for me to click to download the forms to apply for my license!
