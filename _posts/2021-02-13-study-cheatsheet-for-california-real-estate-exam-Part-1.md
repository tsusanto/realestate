## Make sure you know all these terms!

This is my personal study cheat sheet, and now that I've taken and passed the exam, I would say I did pretty well in creating study guide. 

## Key topics:


1) What activities requires a Real Estate Licensee? Without a license, you cannot legally receive compensation for the following:
- Commercial and Residential real estate listings
- Business Broker listings(one who assists in purchase and selling of business opportunity)
- Mobilehome listings, but only if it has been registered with Department of Housing and Community Development
- Prepaid rental listings
- Mortgage loan activities, but must also have a MLO endorsement to receive compensation

2) Can a real estate licensee get referral fees for residential mortgage loans?
- No, it violates RESPA rules. To receive compensation for residential mortgage loans, you must perform active loan originating services, and cannot legally get compensation for plain referral fees.

3) Exemptions from License requirements:
- Owner of property, can buy/sell/lease
- Resident manager of apartments (one who lives on-site)
- Employee of a licensed property manager can show units, accept rental applications without a license
- Short term (<30 days) rental agents
- employees of CFL lenders 


4) What can Unlicensed Assistants do or not do?
- Here is the [best source of information from CA DRE](https://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/guide_unlic_asst.pdf){:target="_blank"}
- To summarize, an unlicensed assistant cannot communicate directly to the public other than handing out material that has been reviewed and approved by the broker 
- While unlicensed assistants can be present at an open house, they are only allowed to hand out marketing materials, greet the public, set up appointments with the licensee. They cannot conduct property tours, or discuss anything to do with the house price, features, neighborhood etc. 
- They can create marketing material, do research like comparative market analysis, but the final output has to be reviewed and approved by the licensee

5) Consumer Recovery Account
- When a person involved in a real estate transaction suffers monetary losses caused by a Real Estate Licensee, he or she can file and obtain payment from the [Consumer Recovery Account](https://www.dre.ca.gov/Consumers/ConsumerRecoveryAccount.html){:target="_blank"}
- Maximum of $50,000 per transaction, maximum payout of $250,000 per licensee
- If payment is made, license is revoked until he or she has repaid the amount plus 10% interest
- Since 1964, the Department has paid more than $65,000,000 (>4000 cases) to members of the public from the Consumer Recovery Account!
