<article class="post-content">
  <h3 id="short-summary">Short Summary</h3>

<p>From start to finish, it would take about 5 months and cost about $600 to get your Salesperson DRE License in California.</p>

<p>While the following steps are for California examinees, the timeline and cost would be quite similar in other states.</p>

<h3 id="step-1---complete-3-required-prelicensing-courses---8---10-weeks-150---200">Step 1 - Complete 3 required prelicensing courses - 8 - 10 weeks, $150 - $200</h3>
<p>You need to take 3 required prelicensing courses, they are 45 hours each. I would highly recommend you take it online, which is usually study at your own pace on demand videos.</p>

<p>At the end of each course, you will be given an open book exam, comprising of 100 multiple choice questions, and you need to get at least a score of 60%.</p>

<p>In California you are required to spend a minimum of 18 days on each course, so that’s at least 56 days for all three courses. That amounts to about 3 hours of classes per day. You have one year to complete the course from your enrollment date.</p>

<p>There are many online prelicensing course providers, my personal favorite is Prepagent, because their videos are fun, the material is dry, but they spice it up with a lot of humor and fun acronyms to help you remember the terms.</p>

<p>With prepagent, their real estate prelicensing course with exam prep package retails for $200. I highly recommend purchasing this combination as being able to do hundreds of practice questions from their exam prep was what helped me pass the exam on my first try.</p>

<p>I had previously signed up with another provider and their presentation was so boring it often put me to sleep. Luckily they had a money back guarantee so I asked for a refund and switched to Prepagent.</p>

<h3 id="step-2---send-in-your-salesperson-exam-application-re400a---6-to-8-weeks-60">Step 2 - Send in your Salesperson exam application (RE400A) - 6 to 8 weeks, $60</h3>

<p>It takes about 6 - 8 weeks for California Department of Real Estate (DRE) to process your exam application and verify that you have completed your required prelicensing courses. DRE provides the current processing time on their <a href="https://www.dre.ca.gov/Licensees/CurrentTimeframes.html" target="_blank">website</a></p>

<p>You need to send in $60 along with the exam application form <a href="https://www.dre.ca.gov/files/pdf/forms/re400a.pdf" target="_blank">(RE400A)</a>. When they approve your application, you will then receive an email inviting you to sign up for an account at their DRE eLicensing system, which is where you would schedule your examination.</p>

<p>You can also apply for a combined license and exam application, but the license application fee of $245 is not refundable should you not pass your exam within 2 years.</p>

<h3 id="step-3---study-for-the-examination---2---6-weeks-0---100">Step 3 - Study for the examination - 2 - 6 weeks, $0 - $100</h3>

<p>As soon as you send in your Salesperson exam application, you can start preparing for your exam. Do not wait until you hear back from DRE before you start studying because that might take weeks.</p>

<p>If you have completed your prelicensing courses but now need to study for the exam, I highly recommend purchasing an exam prep course where you can take thousands of practice questions.</p>

<p>Prepagent sells the exam prep separately for $100. Discount here if you use this link.</p>

<p>If it weren’t for the practice questions, I would not have passed my exam on my first try. From where I live, the driving time roundtrip to Sacramento and test taking time took me almost 8 hours, and I would have been so upset if I failed the test the first time and have to drive back to take it again. The $80 I spent for Prepagent’s exam prep course was very very well spent for me and I am grateful for it.</p>

<p>I would recommend spending 1 - 2 hours everyday studying. Each day, on Prepagent, I would aim to answer at least 100 questions (on their website, you can generate any number of questions for each test). 
As you do the questions, you will see over time that similar topics keep popping up. I cannot emphasize it enough how important it is to answer as many questions as you can. Then study the vocabulary sheet. Prepagent has great (and sometimes funny) videos that focus solely on real estate vocabularies. This would help you in at least answering half the exam questions.
And don’t just memorize the answers. I found that it helped me remember things when I research it online why that answer is correct. When you consistenly score 75% on the simulated tests, it is time to schedule the exam. Usually there should be spots available for the next week, pick one that is about 1 week away.</p>

<p>Prepagent also has short 2-3 minute lessons audio files which you can download to your phone, and play them in the car while you are driving.</p>

<p>I honestly did have a lot of fun attending their live webinars on vocabularies, especially when it’s hosted by Joe Juter, Prepagent’s cofounder. He cracks me up. And I found it fun to give answers through the online chat (they do youtube live streaming for their webinars).</p>

<p>I took 4 weeks total to study for the exam. The first 3 weeks was at a more relaxed pace at about an hour or two per day. Then I scheduled the exam which was for a week later, during which I studied intensively by answering 200 questions everyday for that week.</p>

<p>Read my article on what to expect for the actual DRE Salesperson exam and my own experience taking it in Sacramento.</p>

<h3 id="step-4---apply-for-the-license---2---4-weeks-330">Step 4 - Apply for the license - 2 - 4 weeks, $330</h3>

<p>Assuming you passed your exam on your first try, it would then take another 2 - 4 weeks for DRE to issue you your license after you mail in your license application form (I do not understand why they don’t allow online applications).</p>

<p>Before you send in your application, you need to get your fingerprints taken. Login to your elicensing account, and all the required forms you need will be in your account for you to print, including the Livescan fingerprint forms.</p>

<p><a href="https://oag.ca.gov/fingerprints/locations">Here</a> is a list of all the Livescan providers in California. The Livescan provider will collect from you $49, which goes to Depart of Justice, and however much service fee they charge, which usually runs about $30. Make sure to bring 2 copies of the Livescan form to your livescan provider. They will fill out both forms and return you one of the completed form.</p>

<p>Send in your license application form, completed livescan form along with $245 to DRE. You should hear back from them in about 2 - 4 weeks.</p>

<h3 id="step-5---give-yourself-a-pat-on-the-back">Step 5 - Give yourself a pat on the back</h3>

<p>While it isn’t too hard, it isn’t entirely easy either to get a real estate license. So give yourself a pat on the back for having come so far.</p>

<p>What you choose to do with the license though, is entirely up to you. Here are some ideas what you can do with your newly minted real estate license.</p>
